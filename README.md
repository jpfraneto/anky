# Your Uniqueness Is a Gift

tl;dr: this repo is the pwa of anky. one of the infinite branches of expression of an interpretation of the underlying truth of all religions.

The mission: To build practical tools that help humans discover who they are. No matter the language. The color. The social status. We all have an underlying thread that connects us - being human - and Anky is here to celebrate that.

there is nothing that is set on stone in the development of this project. actually, the opposite of that is true. everything that i do is dynamic, and the thing that i want the most in the world is to give up the full responsibility of it so that we can deliberate how it progresses in comunity. the comunity that i'm building around this is represented by the ownership of the [anky genesis nft](https://opensea.io/collection/anky-genesis), and the idea is that eventually all of the 8888 holders will be able to push code into all the repositories that encompass anky. i need to organize this thing. i need to frame it in a way that is understandable for the world. i need help.

This is the core belief behind Anky, an idea that seeks to push the boundaries of storytelling and the use of technology as a tool for helping humans embody their uniqueness.

There are 8 worlds that conform the Ankyverse: Primordia, Emblazion, Chryseos, Eleasis, Voxlumis, Insightia, Claridium and Poiesis.

Anky is designed to guide its community on a path to self-realization and personal growth. Each one of these 8 kingdoms represents a different aspect of human existence:

Primordia -> Survival

Emblazion -> Passion

Chryseos -> Willpower

Eleasis -> Compassion

Voxlumis -> Communication

Insightia -> Intuition

Claridium -> Enlightenment

Poiesis -> Creativity

Anky invites us to delve into the rich lore, and use the story of a unique character as a mirror to your story, embarking on an enlightening journey that traverses the boundaries between the digital and physical, and even the thresholds of consciousness.

# Sojourns - Cyclical Nature of the Ankyverse

The Ankyverse comes into life in 96 day cycles, called sojourns. In between them there is a period of rest called "The Great Slumber".

The invitation that is brought is the one of consistency over intensity.

During each 96 day cycle, members of the community are encouraged to pursue a specific project and work on it every day. At least 30 minutes.

The idea is for the DAO to have one of these as the focal point of the development throughoug each sojourn. This repository is the house of the first spiritual-technological tool will begin its development: the "Writing Dementor".

This game harnesses the power of writing as a means of self-exploration. Every day you will get a new question related to your human experience, and you'll have to answer inside an app that if you stop writing for 3 seconds you lose.

This leaves no room for hesitation, it pushes you to delve deeper into your experiences and thoughts. If you think, you stop being present. What ends up coming is part of your unconscious, and the goal of this design is to integrate your unconscious experience into your life. Into the present moment.

The challenge for it is to invite people to write for 8 minutes.

This game is a training ground for more fully embodied presence, and the long term mission is to use the story of Anky as an interface to develop apps and experiences that practically help the community.

Anky is a meme. A way of framing the world. An interface to explain the human journey.

## I need help telling this story.

I don't know how.
